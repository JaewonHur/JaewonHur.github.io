I am currently working as a **post doctorial researcher** at **Computer Security Lab** of **Seoul National University**. I received **Ph.D.** at [**Computer Security Lab**](https://compsec.snu.ac.kr), advised by professor [**Byoungyoung Lee**](https://lifeasageek.github.io/). I'm interested in the issues of **system security** in general, but I focused on two topics during my Ph.D: **fuzzing**, and **confidential computing**. As the fuzzing researches, I developed RTL fuzzers, **DifuzzRTL**, and **SpecDoctor**, which were presented at **IEEE S&P** and **ACM CCS**. As the researches on confidential computing, I designed a new model training framework for protecting training data, **DLBox**, which was presented at **NDSS**. In addition I have guided several research projects such as **TeeMate**, solving issues of confidential serverless computing, and **Laputa**, desiging a policy enforcement framework in Apache Spark.
