I am a Ph.D student at Seoul National University (SNU), advised by [Byoungyoung Lee](https://lifeasageek.github.io/) in [Compsec lab](https://compsec.snu.ac.kr). Currently, I am working on privacy enhancing technologies, especially confidential coputing (e.g., Intel SGX, and AMD SEV). More specifically, my research area is on redesigning current big-data, and machine learning platform to protect privacy while preserving efficiency. In addition, I am interesed in various topics in system security such as fuzzing, and software fault isolation.
